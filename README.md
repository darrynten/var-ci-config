# My standard configuration for var.ci

[var.ci](https://var.ci)

These are the rules I use with all of my repos to help automate collaboration and reviews, and to ensure high quality code
is produced.

Some of the rules are from [here](https://var.ci/rules) and others are custom rules of mine.

Feel free to use, modify, improve, or contribute!
